# 🧩 Pokédex Explorer – 24-Hour Hackathon Project

**Pokédex Explorer** is a playful, API-powered web app built during a **24-hour BrainStation Hackathon**. The only requirement: use a public web API in a creative way.

This app taps into the **PokéAPI** to let users search and discover Pokémon details like stats, types, and images. Whether you're a long-time fan or just curious, Pokédex Explorer offers a fast and interactive way to explore the Pokémon universe.
